# [Hossein's Blog](https://hossein.blog)  

The purpose of creating this blog is to develope a way of communication to the world.  

We all have experiences, stories, and knowledge that help, captivate, and encourage others to follow and gain or share the same experience.  

I've decided to share what I already achieved and keep sharing what I'm achieving in my daily life to help my unknown mates to buy times by not wasting time to gain the same experience, or to realize that they're not alone :).  

By evloving back to static webpages, I was tempted to use these platforms such as [Hugo](https://hugo.io) in order to get familiar with them and also to trigger content generation motives.  

Therefore, this blog is developed using Hugo and is using [Netlify](https://netlify.com) as the hosting service using its continous delivery approach.  

I aim to publish at least an article per week about useful experience or knowledge that worth sharing. So, I'll be proud to have you on board ;).
