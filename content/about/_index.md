My profession is programming and web developing in specific. However, please do not get surprised if you see articles from several topics. That's because I'm curious about how things work and don't overthinking it, they absoutely crafted in a way that woth your time. It doesn't hurt to be a T-shaped person. So, let's be one and learn as much as we can and as broad as we can.  

I got my degree in Software Engineering in 2013 from the University of Birjand in Iran. I always appreciate the time I spent there (*but not when I was there!*) as it tought me a lot. Life lessons along with academic expriences. It helped me to prepare my bases and learn abut the very details about how computer works. Don't ask me to create one though. We can learn something easier when we know how it works and I'm not exception here.  

I found it there. I realized that programming, problem solving, and working behind the desk! is my passion. So, let it be. And I did. I started the programming from the beginning and built my knowledge gradually while I was student. It started with lovely C and it went to beloved C++. I enjoyed them indeed but I had enough at that moment. Wanted to exprience something else and C# was there. It wasn't my type actually. I don't know why, but maybe I found it fancy a bit. But, you consider it as my stupidity. We should play with every language and don't be obssessed with some of them (*Still consider me stupid :sweat_smile:*).  

I found **PHP** afterward and I stucked with it. I also was obssessed with it while ago, but I'm a grown man now. I started my career in Iran and after my graduation. It started with developing simple web pages for independent customers as a freelancer. Then, for the first time, I joined a company in 2014. The company itself wasn't much organized, but helped me to code on a more advanced project and learn a thing or two. Maybe three.  

Second company was on my way. I joined them in 2015 and it took my career to the next level. The project I developed in the previous company was noticable but the traffic and marketing wasn't. On the other hand, I had the opportunity to work on higher level projects with millions of requests in the second company. The last and the most advanced project we developed there was a local advertising network (we're sanctioned in Iran, everything's local there. Don't tell me what the heck!).  

After working for almost three years there, I decided to migrate and I chose Malaysia to continue my master degree in Data Science. I was working with a huge amount of data before and it was disappointing that I didn't have enough knowledge about how to manage them and fetch desirable insight. A year before I start my master program, I joined a US based company as a remote developer. It's been two years now that I'm working here and I also graduated in my master program on January 2020.  

This was my professional and academic life. I will write about my personal life in my blog. I had some expriences in my life that worth to be read. They're fun and that's the only reason that I want to share them. However, don't hesitate to take a life lesson from them   :speak_no_evil:.  

**Stay safe & happy**
